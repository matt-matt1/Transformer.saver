# Transformer.saver

Just a little Mac screensaver inspired by [Falun Dafa](http://falundafa.org).  Here’s a screenshot:

## Installation

**[Download the latest release](https://github.com/soffes/clock-saver/releases).** Unzip and double-click.

Alternatively, if you're using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), you can run:
```
$ brew cask install clocksaver
```


## Preferences

Don’t forget to check out “Screen Saver Options…” in System Preferences. You can change the model and style to your liking.


## Building

Xcode 9.3b4 is required since Clock.saver is written in Swift 4.1.


## Watch Faces

The following models are implemented:

* [BN0021 Range](http://braun-clocks.com/watch/BN0021BKBKG)
    * BN0021BKBKG: Black
    * BN0021WHBRG: Brown
* [BN0032 Range](http://braun-clocks.com/watch/BN0032)
    * BN0032WHBKG: White
    * BN0032BKBKG: Black

    * BN0111BKORG: Orange
    * BN0111WHGYG: Grey
    * BN0111BKBKG: Black

Eventually, I'd love to have them all implemented. Here's my [progress](Coverage.markdown).

Enjoy.
